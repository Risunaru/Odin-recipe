    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This full English breakfast of baked beans with eggs, bangers and bacon, seared tomatoes and mushrooms, is traditional in the UK. Just add toast!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can baked beans</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon HP sauce</li>
        <li>3 slices bacon</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
